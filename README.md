# SoccerActionClassification

In this work, it’s proposed an approach to classify the moments of soccer games. From a soccer videos database, it’s used a convolutional neural network, VGG16, to extract the features of the frames that form each game event. Then, using a transfer learning strategy, it’s proposed the events classification by ensemble methods: RandomForest and Gradient Goosting. The results, measured based on the area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) and on mean average precision score (mAP).
